# Fire Fighting (Autonomous and Intelligent Agents in the Fight against Forest Fires)

> A [**_1st year's project_**](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_planos_estudos_view?pv_plano_id=2496&pv_ano_lectivo=2018&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=MI&pv_origem=CUR) of the [**_MSc. degree of Informatics and Computing Engineering_**](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_ano_lectivo=2018&pv_origem=CUR&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=MI&pv_curso_id=742) made in [**_FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto)_**](https://www.fe.up.pt/), in the subject of [**_Agents and Distributed Artificial Intelligence_**](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=420011). This project was built using [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/), [**_JADE (JAVA Agent DEvelopment Framework)_**](http://jade.tilab.com/) and [**_Rapid Miner Studio_**](https://rapidminer.com/products/studio/). The scenario chosen for this project was to combat fires with the use of _flying_ and _terrestrial_ **_autonomous and intelligent vehicles_**, like **_tucks_** and **_airplanes_**. In this scenario we have, as **_agents_**, the **_trucks_**, **_airplanes_** and the **_headquarters_** (responsible for coordinating the **_airplanes_** and **_trucks_**). And also, as an environment, the **_fires_** and the **_water supply stations_** (_rivers_, _seas_, _lagoons_, among others). **_Airplanes_** and **_trucks_** would have limited _fuel_ and _water_ supply capacity.
